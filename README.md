# wagtail-streamfieldtools

A suite of tools that extends [Wagtail's](https://wagtail.io/) already-awesome [StreamField](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.0/topics/streamfield.html) to make it even more flexible/versatile/useful!

Includes:

- A simple interface for displaying the individual blocks of a `StreamField` in any number of renditions.
- A 'block registry' (and its associated field, `RegisteredBlockStreamField`) that makes blocks pluggable/re-usable across disparate models/apps/projects.

TODO:

- Docs (with useful, easy-to-follow examples)!
- Tests!
